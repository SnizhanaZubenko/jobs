		<h1>Online jobs for everyone</h1>
		<p>If work-from-home or remote jobs were still questionable (and most likely a scam) a few years ago, online jobs are now highly desirable because of the flexibility, comfort of working from anywhere and anytime, as well as a decent salary they bring. Thanks to advanced technology, there are many more online work options available.</p>
		<p> There's a list of top 10 online jobs for everyone – from digital nomads, stay-at-home parents, caretakers, retirees, students, and beyond:</p>
		<ul>

			<li>Video Editor</li>
			<p>Video is another hot online trend that is rising fast each year. Lots of businesses need freelancers to create engaging videos for their websites, social media, and YouTube channels. If you know how to edit videos using Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere, for example, the pay is quite promising. You can earn between $25 to $35 an hour as a beginner, and over $50 per hour if you’re experienced. If you have your own hobbies and ideas that are worth sharing, you can even monetize your own YouTube channel. Lots of vloggers film themselves talking about cosmetics, makeup, yoga, healthy living, video games, and so on, while earning money through the YouTube Partner Program.</p>
			<li>Social Media Manager</li>
			<p>Most businesses are switching away from TV, print, or radio ads to invest more in social media since that’s where lots of their customers “hang out” these days. However, many of them aren’t sure what to do, while the workload is tremendous: frequently posting on multiple social media channels, responding to messages, engaging with the audience through comments, managing the ads, etc. Therefore, you can easily find many listings for social media manager positions online. You can also proactively reach out to companies whose social accounts have a rather small number of followers. The pay for social media managers is typically from $15 to $50 an hour, or you can charge a flat monthly fee.</p>
			<li>Freelance Writer & Copywriter</li>
			<p>Writers are in high demand to create new content, blog articles, website copy, and product descriptions on e-commerce channels. People all over the globe are consuming a huge amount of content on the Internet every minute. Though big companies and websites have in-house writers, many smaller sites hire freelance writers and content creators. You can be hired easily if you have some writing samples or a solid portfolio to include with your resume and cover letter. The pay varies depending on your location, writing quality, and who you’re writing for. If you’re a competent writer, you may earn at least $100 per 1,000-word article. For landing page copy, you can even make $1,000 per finished piece. However, please note that the competition is fierce these days, and you’ll probably earn a lot less initially.</p>
			<li>Software Developer</li>
			<p>This probably one of the best paying freelance jobs you can get working remotely? Web Developers are in great demand and lucrative compensation. According to the US Bureau of labor statistics, the 2018 Median Pay for a web developer is $69,430 per year or $33.38 per hour. It also has a bright prospect, where the employment rate is projected to grow 13% from 2018 to 2028. As a result, there are vast online learning resources throughout the Internet to enhance your career shift in becoming a web developer. Here are some popular job boards for online/remote software developer jobs, Upwork, Indeed, Jooble, etc.</p>
			<li>Blogger</li>
			<p>It’s similar to being a freelance writer, yet if you’re confident in your writing skill and want to be your own boss, you can start a blog and build an audience, grow the site and start monetizing it with affiliate advertising, sponsored posts, Google Adsense or product sales. While it doesn’t cost much to start your own blog, you should expect to invest lots of time and effort to grow the blog at first while making no money until it becomes established.</p>
			<li>Virtual Assistant</li>
			<p>Many people run their businesses online these days and hire virtual assistants to help with administrative tasks and keep things organized. This particular online job’s duties vary from answering and sending emails, doing reports, scheduling appointments, creating documents, responding to media inquiries, and more. Virtual assistants typically charge $15 to $35 an hour, depending on years of experience, level of skill required, and who they work for. Some virtual assistants take on multiple clients, allowing quite a comfortable salary.</p>
			<li>Transcriptionist</li>
			<p>If your Word Per Minute (WPM) typing speed is good and your grammar is solid, then transcription job may be for you. All you need to do is to turn audio files into texts. You can get the job done anywhere, anytime, with your computer and perhaps a good headset. Some of the popular transcription sites include TranscribeMe and Scribie. The pay is around $15 to $25 per audio hour.</p>
			<li> Customer Service Representative & Support</li>
			<p>Many companies hire virtual customer service representatives to answer the phone or email to assist customers, process orders, and deal with returns. You’ll need to have a computer and possibly a specific software or equipment provided by the company. It’d help to have a good phone voice, friendly attitude, and patience to work with various customers. Some companies offer 24/7 customer service, so you can find shifts at various hours. However, lots of companies hire call-center representatives overseas for less, thus it’s competitive, and the pay isn’t that high. According to Glassdoor.com, a customer service representative typically gets paid around $30,000 per year. Search the term “customer service representative”, “customer support”, or even “help desk associate” to find the related positions. If you’re good at tech, you might want to check out this Google IT support professional certificate on Coursera. This five-course certificate, developed by Google, is designed to prepare you for an entry-level IT support role. You will land in-person or remote help desk work with responsibilities like troubleshooting, customer service, networking, operating systems, system administration, and security.

Smucker, Infosys, Intel, KForce, PNC Bank, RICOH USA, Sprint, TEKSystems, etc., and of course, Google.</p>
